# paleobio_classification

## Abstract

Finding dinosaur body fossils is rare, and classification of new discoveries is a
complex task. The existing fossil record contains many suspiciously similar genera.
Representing each genus as a vector allows for quick pairwise comparisons and
uncovers possibly problematic records. Geospatial data can further support (or reject)
the possibility that two separately classified genera may actually be the same. While
not conclusive, the methods presented here may enhance current classification
techniques.

## Data

The data for this project was compiled from several tables in the Paleobiology Database: visit https://paleobiodb.org/#/.
